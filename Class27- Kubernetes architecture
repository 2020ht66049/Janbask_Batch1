Kubernetes
==========

Problem with docker:

1) Docker is single host solution, and it is suitable for small scale, but in IT industry we need a distributed large system.

2) To support multi server architecture docker introduce docker swarm, but it's very less popular because in those days[in around 2015] docker was very new to market.

3) Same time Google has lanched K8s which is alternative to docker swarm, it is get very good popularity.

4) Kubernetes architecture

    No more than 110 pods per node
    No more than 5,000 nodes
    No more than 150,000 total pods
    No more than 300,000 total containers

5) Docker container in terms kubernetes is known as pod. pod can be combination of multiple containers.

6) Let's try to understand K8s architecture-

7) Work of master is distribute incoming request to slave nodes.

8) In nodes we have 3 components-
   1) Kubelet [Agent that allow master to slave communication]
   2) kubeproxy[it's Networking componenent]
   3) Pod[Pod is a container, this is very initial level defination]


9) In my master server we have 4 component-
    1) API Server: It is responsible for client communication. 
    2) Schedular: It's primarly responsible for creating and deleting the stuffs.
    3) Controller: It's control the entire flow.
    4) etcd: It's memory component.


Example: 1) Lets say we need 3 container, so client would be requesting to master server[API server component]      
         2) API server will internally task to schedular and get activity done.


Kubernetes installation
=======================
LAB: https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-cka/scenario/playground

Installation: 
I will make video and share with you by Monday, it like running multiple commands

Homework

Issue with docker
=================
>>> if you want to create container with multiple node the it would be problem.

$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -idt springcommunity/spring-framework-petclinic
8b396e8243758deb3c9293e145a33851c80c32e56d1bdb534ecebcf4a04259a1
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint funny_jemison (89b27c81d27fac08b8783e3234f41995c180dd8a9d45b9bce3b4b92ed255604f): Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated.

docker run -idt -p 8081:8081 --name mycontainer nginx

In above command we are running docker container with name:mycontainer, with image:nginx, with port:8081, same thing we are write in kubernetes in YAML format.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mycontainer
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8081


In k8s we define everything in YAML file
Reason: We I can track in GIT.

To write any object K8s has a formarte

apiVersion
kind
metadata
spec[specification]
