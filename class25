Today's Agenda
==================
1) Understanding pipeline steps for any application
       1) Build pipeline
       2) release pipeline

>>> Every programing person follow set of rule to write the code

If(condition)
    echo "Hello"
fi

If(condition)
 echo "Hello"
fi

If(condition)
  echo "Hello"
fi

All above code work fine, suppose I want to create pull request for spring pet clinic, then I need to follow spc codding standards, to review my code standard they have build pipeline, where they have set up rule to review the changes.

#!/bin/bash
echo "umesh"

In release pipeline they run those manual steps to makesure newly added changes are not creating any issue.


2) Plugin in Jenkins
====================
SCM: Source code management(version control system)

I want to configute the GIT with jenkins
GIT URL[https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot], Branch, username, and password[Id provide password, or key]> rsa key-gen 

Link: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/


3) Master slave architecture in jenkins
=======================================
>>> I have created EC2 instance, and open port 8080
>>> installed java 17
       apt-get update
       apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless
>>> Now installed jenkins, please refer https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/

>>> My requirement is I need to java17, java11 and java18 to run my system. But it's not possible in 1 system, because system will alway show the latest software installed.

>>> I want to run my application globally it means I want 1 server in US, 1 in Aus and 1 in India for all 3 Application.

>>> I can create multiple server by selecting availability zone. so, now I have 9 server, 3 server for spring pet clinic, 3 for open MRS and 3 for spring boot.

>>> First problem is also solved, because I am having now in separate server.

4) Exploring jenkins console
Build, post build, build triger, execute

poll scm: it means whenever new change are introduced then we would be running the pipeline.

5) Port: endpoint
End point means what would be my destination> Example, Suppose I want to go to US.
port range 0 to 65535.
port is the entry point for traffic.

A port can be defined as a logical entity in computer networking and software terms. It acts as a communication endpoint for identifying a given process or application on the Linux operating system. A port is a 16-bit (o to 65535) number that differentiates a single application from others on various end systems.

Endpoint> patrick.rohan@gmail.com > it's basically final destination which can not further optimize.

Linux work in the concept of virtual world, to reach to physical server we need entry port.
     physical server
